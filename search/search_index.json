Mu is built around the idea that shipping and maintaining a UEFI product is an ongoing collaboration between numerous partners. For too long the industry has built products using a \"forking\" model combined with copy/paste/rename and with each new product the maintenace burden grows to such a level that updates are near impossible due to cost and risk. Project Mu also tries to address the complex business relationships and legal challenges facing partners today. To build most products it often requires both closed-source, proprietary assets as well as open source and industry standard code. The distributed build system and multi-repository design allows product teams to keep code separate and connected to their original source while respecting legal and business boundaries. Project Mu originated from building modern Windows PCs but its patterns and design allows it to be scaled down or up for whatever the final product's intent. IoT, Server, PC, or any other form factor should be able to leverage the content. Primary Goals Initially this project will focus on two central goals. \ud83d\udd39 Share our active code tree to both solicit feedback and entice partners to collaborate. Project Mu is an active project. This is not a side project, mirror, clone, or example. This is the same code used today on many of Microsoft's 1st party devices and it will be kept current because it must be to continue to enable shipping products. \ud83d\udd39 Promote, evangelize, and support an industry shift to a more collaborative environment so we all can build and maintain products with lower costs and higher quality. Today's open source projects although extremely valuable are very resource intensive to interact with. This friction leads to major industry players avoiding public interaction thus diminishing the overall community\u2019s value. The modern era of open source projects has incorporated new tools and procedures to lower this friction and it is our goal to leverage those tools. GitHub provides issue tracking, Pull Requests, Gated builds, tracked/required web-based code reviews, and CI/CD (Continuous builds and testing). It is our belief that by leveraging and extending this automation and workflow we can lower the friction and foster a safe place for all contributors to work. Guiding Principles Less is More * Be open to change / flexible - Keep learning. If it was easy this would have been solved before Design for code reuse Leverage tools / invest in automation Navigation Have a look around this site to see what is Project Mu, why is it different, how to work within or extend it, as well as where everything is located.

As you can probably tell, Project Mu is based on TianoCore . It represents a variant of TianoCore that was customized within Microsoft for scaling and maintainability. It's not exactly a staging branch for TianoCore, as there are some changes that may not have application within or meet the explicit goals of that project, but it is a place where features and changes can be publicly featured and discussed. So, is this a fork? Not entirely. It is our goal to continue to treat TianoCore as a true upstream. Our release branches will always be based on the latest stable TianoCore release, and we will always try to PR viable fixes and features into the TianoCore project. What is it? Where is it going? Project Mu is a product of the Microsoft Core UEFI team and is the basis for the system firmware within a number of Microsoft products. It will continue to be maintained to reflect the FW practices and features leveraged for the best experience with Windows and other Microsoft products. A secondary purpose is to engage with the community, both in TianoCore and the industry at large. We hope that Project Mu serves as a concrete example for discussing different approaches to managing the challenges faced by the UEFI ecosystem. Is this really following \"Less is More\"? Yes. The idea is lowering the entanglement of code, lowering the coupling, and allowing the product to pick and choose the code it needs. This means when building any given product, you don't need all the Project Mu code.

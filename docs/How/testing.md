# Testing

Project Mu testing infrastructure has a few main components:

* The MsUnitTestPkg in Mu Basecore contains all of the libraries and business logic to build a unit test app leveraging the Mu unit test framework.
* The UefiTestingPkg in Mu Common Plus contains several types of tests for existing technologies. We strive to add more all the time.
* The XmlSupportPkg in Mu Common Plus contains helper libraries for formatting test results to be viewed on host systems.
